        <p>
          Currently a first year student at the IESEG School of Managment, following the Programme Grande √âcole. I had the opportunity to follow my college and high school in a bilingual school that allowed me to obtain my baccalaureate OIB (option international baccalaureate). 
          The preparation of this diploma allowed me to open myself more to the world and to acquire new skills, such as a better understanding of the world as well as strengthen my critical analysis. Moreover, this school has made me a bilingual and autonomous person. 
          Through my involvement in many projects within the institution, including engagement in the Student Council, I had the opportunity to carry out multiple charitable and environmental actions (fundraising for research against breast cancer and pediatric cancer, world clean up day...). I really like to learn new things and discover more about what surrounds me. 
          I am open to opportunities that will allow me to grow personally and professionally.

        <h2> ‚úàÔ∏èüéæ My hobbies </h2>
        <p>
          I am passionate about <strong>traveling</strong>.
          I love discovering new places around the world. I love exploring new countries and discover landscapes and cultures all over the world. I'd love to travel to Asia, especially to Japan and Thailand. I also really enjoy learning new languages. During coll√®ge and lyc√©e, I've been able to learn english (I am bilingual now), german and chinese. Now that I am in IESEG, I'm taking the italian course, hoping that I'll be able to speak fluently one day.

          Another hobby of mine is tennis. I used to play 5 hours a week but now, due to the amount of work, I only play 3h3O a week. I play tennis since I'm 10 and I play it in competition. I also enjoy watching tennis matches. I usually play with my friends and go 2/3 weeks during summer holidays to La Baule and play in 8 to 10 tournaments.

        <h2> My objectives üíª</h2>
        <p>
          One of my main <strong>objective</strong> this year is being able to have a good ranking in order to be able to go to the university I want, in Norway. 
          On the long term, I also wish to be able to have a successful life, meaning a good family, reliable friends and a job that I like.
